**Craft Calendars adds full-featured Calendar and Event management to your Craft-powered website.**

### Features

- Any Element can be placed onto a calendar and made into an event. (Why you'd want your Assets to be events is beyond me, but who am I to stop you?)

- Events can repeat Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly, or on Selected Dates — either with a "repeat until" limit, or recurring forever.

- You can manage events on multiple calendars.

- Use the the `craft.calendars.events` tag in your templates to retrieve events and dates, sorted and filtered by calendar, date range, element type, section, etc.

- Use the `craft.calendars.month` template variable to access a monthly calendar grid — either as a simple utility, or with all your event data attached.

- Use the `craft.calendars.calendars` template variable to access a list of all your calendars.
