### Get a License

A license is required for every installation of Craft Calendars. Please [purchase a license](/guide/index.html#Buy-Calendars) for your project before making it publicly available.


## Installing

1. Un-zip the Craft Calendars download and move the `calendars` directory into your Craft plugins directory (usually `craft/plugins`).

1. In your Craft control panel, go to **Settngs > Plugins** page, find _Craft Calendars_ in the plugin list, and click **Install**.


## Updating

When a newer version of Craft Calendars becomes available, Craft will add a link to the Updates feed in the control panel, alerting you to the update and prompting you to download and install the new version.


## Migrating from Private Beta

Version 0.8 of the _Craft Calendars_ beta introduced a completely new scheme for storing and querying event data.â€‹ This allowed us to significantly improve speed, data safety, and usability.

Before updating from 0.6.x, review the [Updating From Beta](/guide/updating-from-beta.html) page for information on updating your _Craft Calendars_ beta installation.
