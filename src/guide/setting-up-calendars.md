Each Event in your system will belong to one Calendar. You can set them up in the Calendars tab in your control panel.


## Create Calendars

With the plugin installed, a **Calendars** section will appear in the menu of your control panel.

Browsing to the **Calendars** section (using the menu item, or by clicking the _Calendars_ plugin icon on the Settings page) brings up a list of your calendars.

Here, you can create new calendars or edit the name/handle of an existing calendar.

## Referencing Calendars

Interacting with calendars is similar to interacting with Craft's own entry sections: In your template code, you'll usually reference a calendar by its unique _handle_.
